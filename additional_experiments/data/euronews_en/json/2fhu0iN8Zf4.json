So what is this then going to mean if you could elaborate. Are we going to perhaps see unfortunately an uptick in unsafe abortions. Yeah it's said that about a quarter of all women will receive an abortion before the age of 45. So they're going to this really going to affect a lot of women nationwide as there are already studies as late as last year. A study coming out of the University of Colorado in Boulder saying that there will be an uptick of about 21 percent of women that will be affected by seeking an abortion that may not be done by a medical facility. And this number could increase 33% for Black American women. So we see already there is a disparate amount of people that will be impacted by this law in America. The CDC also says that there are indications that this could show an uptick and this could result in an uptick in women seeking illegal abortions as well. And then of course we have the laws of what happens when someone does have an abortion that is not legally sanctioned. This could result in years in prison by up to five to 15 years. This would be considered a class B felony meaning that this would mean prison time for women who are convicted of receiving an illegal abortion. A class B felony. So what's the reaction then been across the political divide. I mean this is of course a huge victory for conservatives. But what have leading Democrats been saying about this. Yeah of course Democrats are definitely outraged and they're looking to take this as a political action and of course a talking point and then for people to get activated come this November for midterm elections. They want people to respond to the Supreme Court decision at the polls to vote in people who would definitely be more favorable and more open to the issue of women's health care."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [766.84, 771.26], "sentence": " So, of course, we already heard House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking about this."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [771.26, 777.48], "sentence": " We are expecting the president of the United States, Joe Biden, to make a statement about the Supreme Court decision."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [777.48, 783.24], "sentence": " But this will definitely be a big decision in November when people head out to vote."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "timestamp": [783.24, 806.06], "sentence": " It will indeed.
