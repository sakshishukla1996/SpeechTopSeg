That is the question that economists are asking as inflation across the eurozone hits a record high of 8.9 percent and according to the EU Statistics Office Eurostat the rising cost of energy food industrial goods and services are to blame now the European Central Bank last week announced a hike in interest rates for the first time in 11 years but Eurostat also found that GDP across the eurozone is on the rise with a 0.7% increase seen across the block in the on the rise with a 0.7% increase seen across the block in the second quarter of the year.

So what is the diagnosis then I guess about the health of the eurozone right now. Basically we have a situation of so far so good.

And therefore also on whether or not we may or may not need to ration gas for industry etc. in some countries. So excuse me. In that sense you know the the short term interest rate outlook is very clear. But we are still in a situation where ultimately what will tame inflation potentially is the expected growth slowdown in the euro area in the second half of 2022. Briefly Jacob if you don't mind are there any countries which are looking a little bit more concerning than others right now. Well I don't think there's any doubt that the flat growth in Germany already in the second quarter is a cause of concern because we know that Germany is one of the countries that have to reduce domestic demand for gas the most. It is one of the countries that is most exposed to potential rationing of gas for heavy industrial use.
