If they do decide to send in the kind of heavy artillery that the Ukrainians are asking for. Could the Ukrainians then possibly push back the Russians and even retake the city of Severodonetsk. Well Ukrainians are definitely thinking that way and they have been very open about what exactly they need. Now there are two problems here. This is not only about sending enough weapons and heavy weapons but this is also about sending it on time. Ukraine is really greatly outnumbered by Russian artillery and western aid despite all the promises is arriving way too slow and in rather small quantities for the moment. Now to give you the example how outnumbered Ukraine is the ratio there sometimes goes to 10 to 1 or even 15 to 1 in terms of artillery pieces available in combat specifically in the east where the heaviest fighting is taking place right. Now Kiev requested they just made it public the list and the requested items on that list and I'm going to just pick up one of the items there for example we see 500 tanks. Now this is the least as per presidential advisor this is what Ukraine needs to end the war. And we have 500 tanks there on the list. According to the military balance 20 21 database when it comes to the countries like the UK France and Italy all of them have between 200 to 230 tanks each so five hundred tanks that's really a lot of course this is a rather best-case scenario of you what Ukrainian authorities are hoping to receive from Western Airlines of course after all the promises that they've made the deputy defense minister of Ukraine said that as of now Kiev gets about 10% of what it needs to end this war all right we'll see what kind of decisions come out of Brussels later on tonight and tomorrow."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [986.58, 989.12], "sentence": " Sasha Vakulina, thank you so much for your time."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [989.12, 997.3], "sentence": " Now ahead of Sunday's second round of voting, the results of the National Assembly elections in France have been questioned."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [997.3, 1003.68], "sentence": " Members of the left-wing alliance NOUPS have accused the interior ministry of manipulating the results."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [1003.68, 1005.42], "sentence": " Sophia in the Cube has been investigating."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [1005.42, 1014.74], "sentence": " Yes, Per, and with this extremely narrow gap separating the presidential alliance ensemble and the left-wing alliance noobs, every vote matters."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [1014.74, 1022.3], "sentence": " Now, according to the ministry of the interior, the current presidential alliance is currently leading by only 20,000 votes."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [1022.3, 1036.08], "sentence": " But other French media, such as Le Monde, have claimed that it is actually Noops that is ahead, which as you can imagine has caused quite a bit of controversy online with certain users stating that the French authorities are manipulating the numbers."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [1036.08, 1105.82], "sentence": " And certain politicians such as Manuel Bompard, who is one of the key figures of the Noops alliance, took to his Twitter to state that over 265,000 votes were incorrectly counted last Sunday.

The politician includes in his calculations three candidates that were not counted in the NOOPS Alliance as well as certain candidates in the French overseas territories. And although it is true that the ministry did not count the votes of these candidates, Dominique Poitier, Hervé Solignac and Joël Aviragnier as Noups votes, but instead categorized them as various left party votes. And this is because these three candidates initially ran under the Noups Alliance and then withdrew their candidacy and ran as independent left-wing candidates.
