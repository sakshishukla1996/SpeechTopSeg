Now Erdogan appears to be walking this diplomatic tightrope, I guess, in real time right now between Russia, between Ukraine. But I guess the question is, ultimately, what is he looking to achieve? So I would say Turkey's Ukraine war policy really needs to be fleshed out. On the one hand, Turkey supports Ukraine militarily."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [162.98, 207.08], "sentence": " On the other hand, Turkey keeps ties with Russia open economically. And I think the latter part has a lot to do with Turkish President Erdogan's plan to open the economy in Turkey strong ahead of elections scheduled for next year. Tourism and trade with Russia are key components of Erdogan's vision to open the economy. So I think he will maintain economic ties with Russia, notwithstanding Turkey's support to Ukraine. In the big geostrategic picture, I think Turkey supports Ukraine. Turkey sees Russia as its nemesis to the north. And I think Ankara will do everything to make sure that Ukraine is victorious at the end of the war. This is, for instance, why Turkey has provided Ukraine with drones, which have helped the Ukrainians deny Russians air superiority."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [207.08, 210.64], "sentence": " I want to talk about Erdogan's bid for re-election in a moment."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [210.64, 215.28], "sentence": " But first, I want to ask you, you know, it appears to be a fine line for the Turkish president."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [215.28, 222.42], "sentence": " Is there the risk that at a certain point with this strategy, he could run out of road, though, and be asked to make a choice?"}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [222.42, 256.02], "sentence": " Well, Erdogan's brand has always been that he likes to play actors against each other. You know he has done this in Syria playing Russia and the U.S. against each other to achieve Turkey's goals. And I think he's also doing this now in the Black Sea area. So Turkey basically strategy is that it also wants to brand itself as the only country that can talk to both Russians and Ukrainians. And for a while, perhaps this was hype, but we saw that it came to fruition when Turkey delivered the grain corridor, allowing for wheat and grain exports from the Black Sea."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [256.02, 271.12], "sentence": " It was the country that inked and clinched that deal.

So right now we've got a situation in which both Belgrade and Pristina are seeking EU membership. But of course, as you've just mentioned, Serbia still considers Kosovo as part of its territory. So what does that mean for both of them when it comes to the question of joining the bloc. Well at the end of the day neither of them can join the European Union until that relationship is settled. Kosovo is not recognized by five EU member states and that of course blocks it. It's perspective to join the EU and Serbia cannot really join without recognizing Kosovo one way or another. And this was made clear recently by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And this is the view of quite a number of other EU member states."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [490.46, 505.12], "sentence": " So neither of them can join.
