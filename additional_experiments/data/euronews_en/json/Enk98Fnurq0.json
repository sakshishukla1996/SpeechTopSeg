There were six missiles out of them three got intercepted. Indeed over the past couple of days Russia stepped up the airstrikes on Ukraine and this is something that could be somehow explained this equals the statement by some of the US officials that said that Russian force are increasingly relying on artillery and missile strikes to advance their operations in Ukraine the Institute for the Study of War also points out that they continue to burn through their supply of high precision weaponry. And the UK Defense Ministry intelligence report also says that Russia filled the core elements of six different armies yet achieved only tactical success at Severodonetsk. Therefore, this is why this is something that can explain this new strategy. What about what about the potential response from the West beyond criticism. What could the West be doing at this point.
