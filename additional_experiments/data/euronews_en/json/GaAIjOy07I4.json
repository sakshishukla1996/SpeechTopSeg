Now, this is the latest day of strikes. We've seen several already this summer. There will therefore be knock on disruption tomorrow. There's also a tube strike tomorrow. Then another day of strikes on Saturday with then a knock-on on Sunday. So it won't be back to normal on Britain's rails until next week. Yesterday, we also had the communications workers balloted and the mail workers in the UK have also decided to go on strike in the coming weeks. And there are now votes pending for the teachers, for nurses, for the firefighters as well. So we could see in the autumn the biggest wave of industrial action in the UK since the 1970s.
