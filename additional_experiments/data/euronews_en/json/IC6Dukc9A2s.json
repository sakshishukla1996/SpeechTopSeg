Sasha, it is an important weekend coming up where you are there in Kiev at the anniversary of the killing of protesters on the Maidan in 2014. And I think it's fair to say that eight years on for many Ukrainians, the struggle goes on. So how will the anniversary be marked there? Indeed, the 18th, the 19th and the 20th of february of 2014 were some of the saddest and the bloodiest days in ukraine's history and every year these there are commemorations in the country all over the country uh marking the memory of those more than a hundred people killed and more than two thousand and five hundred injured of those but of course the whole situation the commemorations of these dates have a different meaning this year with everything that's been happening at Ukraine's borders and in the east.
