What is inside it? Is it what Zelensky was asking for? Well, let's see. There are two significant things here. First of all, because this is a continued support by the United States of America. This is the second time he's announcing it within just days or weeks, right? And then secondly this is very significant because there is some heavy weaponry in that aid package. We do know there will be some howitzers artillery rounds tactical vehicles tactical drones. So this is exactly the weaponry that Zelensky has been asking for from his Western allies. Why. Because he said look for for example for places like Mariupol there are two ways of unblocking them one is the negotiating diplomacy and we've seen that this did not work until now and the other one is heavy fighting and for this heavy fighting there are Ukrainian soldiers there are forces but they do need heavy weapons they can fight with all right Sasha Vakulina as ever your insights your knowledge of course greatly appreciated Sasha you.
