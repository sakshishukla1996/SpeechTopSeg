But when it comes to the European Central Bank, its only mandate is actually price stability, and that's inflation. The ECB wants to see the inflation at 2%. The latest one is 4.9% in November. That's, of course, more than a double. We're not really seeing that coming down soon. We're not really seeing that coming down soon.
