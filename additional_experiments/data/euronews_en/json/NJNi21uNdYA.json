Now, those rules ebbed and flowed over the course of the pandemic. But it is very clear, despite Downing Street's denials previously and still today, that the police now believe that a number of individuals inside Downing Street broke the law and have to pay these fines. Now, this is just the first batch of fines. As you mentioned, there are 20 of them. But over 100 people have been sent questionnaires over these parties by the police. So we could well be seeing more of these fines being issued. It is highly embarrassing for the government.
