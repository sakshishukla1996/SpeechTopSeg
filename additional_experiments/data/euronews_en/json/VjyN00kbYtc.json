So they have signed a deal with the U.N. Russia has signed a parallel deal, as your introduction mentioned.

Of course there are the practicalities of the deal are fraught with problems potential problems. Implementation will be very challenging. So at this stage I think it's too early to say that the the the danger of a food crisis is over that the famine fears are past. But it certainly looks like a step in the right direction. As you say Peter still very much a glimmer of hope at this stage, but you point to the fact that it's not a bilateral deal in the traditional sense."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [171.36, 178.52], "sentence": " So, you know, one would think that this points to the fact that for the Ukrainians there wasn't necessarily full trust here."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [178.52, 235.82], "sentence": " So have they been given any assurances from the Russians that they won't be attacked from an open up an opened up position well I think the Ukrainian position is clear that they don't regard that Russian words or statements or signed documents or anything coming from Moscow to be of any worth whatsoever of course Russia has many many international commitments and bilateral groups to Ukraine it has since invaded Ukraine and is now engaged in what Ukrainians believe to be a war of destruction a war of annihilation. They are wiping out Ukrainian towns and cities systematically. So the notion that there could be some form of a contractual agreement or deal with Russia is actually considered to be absurd in Ukraine at this point.

Russia remains a permanent member of the Security Council and is essentially immune to sanction from the EU from the United Nations side. I think if the if the deal were to break down all that we would see would be simply it would be officially abandoned and Russia would receive the blame and the program from the international community would be condemned. And Russia would. I think that's crucially from Russia's point of view. They would lose a lot of their credit amongst the developing world which is a key area of Russian foreign foreign policy at the moment. Russia having essentially burned its bridges with the Western world, is looking very much to secure a position within the developing world to strengthen its position there. Now, if it's seen to be causing widespread famine, obviously that would be hugely damaging for Russia.

Well as Europe attempts to navigate the energy crisis there are huge questions as to whether countries can secure new sources of fuel while staying true to climate targets. All of that against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. Joining me now is Alessio Terzi, he is an economist and the author of the book Growth for Good. Alessio great to have you with us thanks for being with us. When we think about climate change, I think there are some people who would argue that essentially capitalism got us to this point. Capitalism got us to a stage where the planet is rapidly heating up. So can we continue to operate within the confines of that system if we want to save the planet. What would you say to that?"}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [545.48, 549.5], "sentence": " Thanks for having me."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [549.5, 558.02], "sentence": " What I try to argue in the book is that, you know, capitalism has many negative sides to it, perhaps."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [558.02, 649.24], "sentence": " But if there is one thing that it is good at, it is that it is a good machinery to foster innovation and this is something we're going to need a lot of in in order to green our economy and to roll out new technologies and so what i try to say is perhaps it is more useful rather than a dream of of destroying the whole system to try and think what is needed in order to reorient the system and enroll capitalism in our battle against climate change well Alessia boy as you say there I mean we are going to need that Innovation very much so but we've also got a situation where we've just seen U.S President Biden come back from Saudi Arabia for, with a request to pump more oil. European countries saying we don't want to cut off Russian gas. Germany looking at coal again. Do you think that these countries will get on board with the innovation, with the green transition in a timely fashion when they've got a deal with a cost of living crisis and looking their electorate in the face. So perhaps against conventional wisdom I would argue that the result of this energy crisis will actually be an acceleration in the green transition. And as you say it might look strange right now because we are doing these things like reopening coal fired power plants. And so climate despair would look natural."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [649.24, 663.78], "sentence": " But I would argue that what is happening right now is that the polluting option, whether it is methane, whether it is gasoline, is becoming much more expensive, which makes the green option much more palatable."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [663.78, 667.5], "sentence": " And so we will see a switch by consumers that accelerates."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [667.5, 675.62], "sentence": " A year ago, I would have to try and persuade my friends to buy an electric car, and they would say it's much more expensive, I'll never get the money back."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [675.62, 684.34], "sentence": " Right now, it is much cheaper to drive an electric vehicle than it is for the internal combustion engine option."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [684.34, 692.0], "sentence": " And we're seeing governments as well invest or put much more money on the table ENERGY SECURITY REASONS, WE ARE SEEING A LOT MORE INVESTMENT IN THE ENERGY SECURITY REASONS IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAN IT IS FOR THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE OPTION."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [692.0, 732.84], "sentence": " WE ARE SEEING GOVERNMENTS AS WELL INVEST OR PUT MUCH MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR ENERGY SECURITY REASONS IN RENEWABLES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEVERE THE LINKS WITH RUSSIA AND WITH FOSSIL FUELS. I WOULD ARGUE IF WE GO BEYOND argue that if we go beyond the very short term in the medium to long term we will see an acceleration in the green transition. Do you think this is a bit of a branding issue even from governments then for example to sell these green alternatives because right now when people are going through a cost of living crisis you make the case there yourself very clearly in the long run about these kind of options being more affordable. But when people are trying to get to the end of the month they're maybe just not seeing it that way. Do you think that governments need to do a better job at just selling that to electors."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [732.84, 749.24], "sentence": " So I think there is part of a narrative problem in the sense that we frame the green transition as costs costs costs. It's more costly. It's the cost of option and so on. And there is nothing written in the stars that says that the green option must be the expensive option."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [749.24, 756.34], "sentence": " So I think that there is a narrative problem there, but there is a reality, which you're hinting at, which is right now there is a cost of living crisis."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [756.34, 760.44], "sentence": " And so, you know, the energy crisis is not good."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [760.44, 805.74], "sentence": " It's not a good thing, aside from the fact that there are obviously atrocities related to the war. But there are people that are having trouble making it to the end of the month, and it is going to be more challenging from a macroeconomic perspective. And so governments will have to intervene, help out those in need in the economy. It will be challenging. We will have to bring inflation under control. So there are challenges, and there are choppy waters ahead. But if we manage to go beyond the next few months, which will be tough, I think that there is a greener world ahead of us. All right. Challenges, but potentially also opportunities ahead. The message there from Alessio Terzi, an economist and the author of the book, as you can see there, Growth for Good. Pleasure to have you on, Alessio. Thank you."}]]}
