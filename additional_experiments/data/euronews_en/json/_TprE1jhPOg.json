At the moment, she's a leader that really is without credibility, without authority, and without any kind of democratic legitimacy. And I think, at the moment, most governments midway through their terms are simply planning in know in terms of months or years. But actually this is a government that's trying to cling on really on a day to day moment by moment basis. So I think she's probably done enough in terms of trying trying to buy herself a little bit of time. Hopefully you know in terms of trying to get to October the 31st for the the fiscal statement but certainly I don't think it really has changed the fundamental situation that she's facing which is a very premature end to a premiership only 43 days into taking the job it did appear in Prime Minister's questions that there was another u-turn as well when it came to pensions and she could have potentially undermined her Chancellor there who of course she needs Jeremy Hunt's support and the support of her cabinet so do you think that could be problematic for her? I think from a sort of technical point of view obviously you know one side or the other will come out as supreme and obviously you know she is reliant upon the support of Jeremy Hunt in terms of trying to survive and maintain a cohesive cabinet."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [466.76, 525.24], "sentence": " But I think really what the major significance of it is that it really shows that this is not a government that has sort of a very cohesive approach. And even though it's trying to sort of turn a new leaf in terms of trying to set a new policy trajectory, actually, it's still having problems in trying to manage messages and also trying to manage just basic policy going forward. So I think it's possible that she was simply trying to assert authority following a few days where authority seemed to sap away from her towards her new chancellor. But I think from a political perspective, it doesn't look very good. But also from a sort of economic and fiscal perspective potentially this may be an issue going forward having to raise pensions by 10 when already after the u-turns the government remains 38 billion pounds uh you know in in sort of a shortfall so i think certainly from a political perspective it's difficult but also from an economic perspective and a fiscal perspective it looks very difficult for her as well."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [525.24, 534.14], "sentence": " Finland has moved a step closer to approving the construction of a fence along parts of its border with Russia."}], [{"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [534.14, 542.06], "sentence": " Prime Minister Sanna Marin says there is a growing cross-party support, which has gained traction since Russia's invasion of Ukraine."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [542.06, 560.3], "sentence": " Helsinki is concerned over a possible large-scale and illegal cross-border migration.
