So which countries are most affected by food safety issues? The burden of foodborne diseases can affect all countries, but the low- and middle-income countries are most, are more affected. They are, they have people that are more vulnerable, and they are more exposed to foodborne diseases. This can be because of their food control systems are not strong enough to detect and prevent foodborne diseases, but also because of the lack of infrastructure that can, for example, cause contamination of food and water that is used to food processing or to wash or to irrigation. So that can affect more and that can cause more contamination to people. And especially the most vulnerable are the ones in low and middle-income countries. So finally what can people at home do to make sure that the food they're eating is safe? Yeah this is a very good question. There are five measures that everyone can take at home.
