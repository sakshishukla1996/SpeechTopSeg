We said also, we commented on the fact that yesterday's debate actually showed how political parties have already embarked on what now seems to be a political campaign.

But also let's remind ourselves that Italy's alignment under a new government under let's say a center right government would be much different especially when it comes to relations with Europe relations with other international partners.

We heard from Paolo Gentiloni, that's the EU commissioner for Italy in charge of the economy, saying that this could bring about chaos over the next couple of months in Italy itself and create a backlash against the country.

Well of course while introducing these European targets you always have some countries that want to claim they are special and want to claim they need a different treatment but here I think we need to understand that reducing demand by 15% is something that would allow everybody and Europe overall to get a more efficient management of this. We would be better off all together if we are to go down this pathway indicated by the European Commission. And I think right what can be negotiated possibly is a compensation for those countries that are less dependent on Russian gas and can provide solidarity to other European countries that are more vulnerable.
