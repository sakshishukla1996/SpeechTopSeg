This is something we're looking at very closely at the moment and in fact what the information that we have is that COVID-19 hospitalizations in the past couple of weeks have decreased not increased. The reasons for that are still not quite clear. And it could well be that people have been discharged early from hospital to make space for other health needs. People may have left hospitals voluntarily, and people in hospital may have died. We've made it very clear that oxygen distribution for COVID-19 in hospitals is a critical need at the moment. And without good oxygen provision, we will have more deaths. Of course, people congregating on the move in environments that are overcrowded are going to lead to increased transmission of all communicable diseases, including COVID-19."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [1402.64, 1463.28], "sentence": " And we can see very clearly from the images that we're seeing that people are not focused on their own protection in that regard. It's that prioritizing their physical safety and their well-being. So we need to reinforce these principles. We also need to reinforce these principles of infection prevention and control. Also where humanitarian organizations are coming in, where we have NGOs, international organizations setting up camps, helping refugees in neighboring countries. We all need to be very cognizant that COVID-19 is circulating widely across Europe and for Ukrainians it represents a specific risk because of their low vaccination uptake for COVID-19. 34% of the adult population has completed their vaccination series. Only one third of over 60s have. So these populations are at especially high risk of severe COVID-19 and we need to focus on protecting them from us, but also themselves."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [1463.28, 1466.0], "sentence": " Thank you very much, Dr. Smallwood."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "timestamp": [1466.0, 1471.36], "sentence": " I'd like to take a question here that we received in advance, moving to the issue of refugees again."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [1471.36, 1513.2], "sentence": " Dr. Kluger, we've discussed discrimination and racism, but we've received a question from Ed Holt at The Lancet about the specific health threats that we anticipate refugees will be facing as they leave and settle in different countries?

To start with the mental health, what Dr Smallwood was mentioning, in any conflict about one out of five people any conflict about one out of five people is facing mental ill health and the longer particularly children are exposed to conflict separation of families witnessing atrocities"}], [{"speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "timestamp": [1513.2, 1525.92], "sentence": " then the long-term impact is increasing so that's definitely a top priority.

So mental health for the workforce becomes even more important in this office here thank you thank you dr kluge let's take uh jenny lay ravelo i believe from devics jenny please unmute yourself and ask your question hi thank you um there was a mention earlier about the need for mental health expertise i just want to clarify if that's inside ukraine or at the border and are there other health expertise needed at the moment inside Ukraine? And a second related question is, do you have concerns of potential healthcare worker shortages and what's the plan to address that if that's the case?"}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "timestamp": [1658.64, 1666.0], "sentence": " Thank you so much.

I was at a train station in Jezov at the border of Poland and there the medical students were asked to do the triage and referral the same for the midwife so emergencies stimulate innovation and then we need to look at task shifting which tasks can be shifted from the medical doctor to the nurse to the community worker and also to digital tools this is on the on the health workforce thank you dr smallwood if you would like to come in on that at all and just very specifically on on what we're doing to scale up uh mental health support both within within Ukraine but also in the countries that are receiving large influxes of refugees from Ukraine. We've already deployed mental health expertise to surrounding countries and we're beefing up the support through our Ukraine country office."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "timestamp": [1755.76, 1830.42], "sentence": " What we know is that much of the time during complex situations mental health and psychosocial support is crucially important and sometimes needs to be delivered through primary health care mechanisms and we spend a lot of time training our workforce at the primary health care level to be able to cater and address the mental health needs of these populations. We're also bringing in people with direct experience in Ukraine, having worked in Ukraine, Ukrainians themselves, to help local authorities tailor the mental health support directly to those refugees. This needs to continue and be scaled up over time. The mental health needs will only grow as the conflict continues. Great, thank you very much. And actually on this note, I'm going to close this press briefing for today thank you very much for all the panelists dr kluger regional director dr smallwood tarik thank you very much for taking the time from your busy day in ukraine and please stay safe out there and thank you to you the members of the press for joining this press briefing today if you do need additional follow-up please do just get in touch.
