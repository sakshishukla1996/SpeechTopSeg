Now, Downing Street has denied that that's what's happening, but many would say that the proof is in the very nature of the announcements themselves. Populist policies designed to appeal to that right wing of the Conservative Party and bring them back on side.

Meanwhile, there's also a poll of grassroots members of Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, ordinary members, which show that 40% of them want Boris Johnson to resign. Now, perhaps that's because these right-wing policies haven't had enough chance to catch on with the general public, or perhaps that's because these right-wing policies haven't had enough chance to catch on with the general public, or perhaps it's because the public won't be that... won't be distracted by them."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [593.68, 602.88], "sentence": " So the prime minister obviously facing another tough week, with opposition leader Keir Starmer likely to grill him on Wednesday."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [602.88, 606.72], "sentence": " What can we expect?"}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "timestamp": [606.72, 614.62], "sentence": " Well, certainly, Keir Starmer last week went for the jugular, playing his Trump card by calling for Boris Johnson to resign."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "timestamp": [614.62, 668.94], "sentence": " It might be a little trickier for him this week because subsequently we've also had photos distributed of him enjoying a beer with colleagues in a constituency office around the same time as that infamous May 20th party for which Boris Johnson apologised.
