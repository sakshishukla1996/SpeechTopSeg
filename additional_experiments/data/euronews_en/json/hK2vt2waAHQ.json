Later on today though she will leave it for the final time and there will be a procession through the streets of London, down the Mall, through Horse Guards Parade where of course she did the Trooping of the Colour every year, along Whitehall, past Downing Street, and to the Palace of Westminster, where the House of Commons and the House of Lords is. Part of that building is Westminster Hall. It dates back over 900 years, the time of the Norman invasion. It's the oldest part of the palace itself, and it has played host to many events through the years. It was originally the original site of the British itself and it has played host to many events through the years. It was originally this original site of the British justice system, there were courts in there but there's also a banquet hall used by the likes of Henry VIII and it's been used for the banquets of coronations and monarchs ever since but also for their lying in states. Indeed the Queen's own father George VI and her mother Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother lay in state in the hall and many of the previous monarchs did as well and so what will happen is the Queen will be placed in the centre of that hall on a platform the coffin will have the royal standard put on top as well as the orb and sceptre and crown as well and then we will expect the queuing which has already started will start to move into the hall now people are being told to prepare for a long queue upwards perhaps of 15 hours on a course that stretches back through London about five or six miles. They're being told to come dressed formally to only bring a very small bag and to be prepared for that long wait. Once they do get to the hall then they will go through airport style security and they will be able to pay their final respects. They're being told they were not allowed to do any photography or filming, use mobile phones or any handheld devices, that it has to be at all times respectful."}]]}
