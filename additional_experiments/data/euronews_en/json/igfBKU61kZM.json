So Severodonetsk is not gone, but the next step is going to most likely to be Lysyschansk, which will lead to the fall of Luhansk, and then crossovers in Donetsk, Odessa, where they launched 14 missile strikes around today, and of course, Kharkiv. Now, you mentioned the word saga there. The NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, he's warned, of course, that the war in Ukraine could last years. Is that your take then? Well, my take is that it's going to last a very long time because even the Ukrainians are admitting that Russia's got the financial capabilities and the military wherewithal to carry out this war for another one to two years. A lot of the predictions that began in late March that Russia was running out of the kind of missiles and munitions that it would need to sustain the war in the long term haven't seemed to have panned out.

So right now, the Russians are almost smug and confident about their position, so they probably aren't willing to engage in talks. But if the Ukrainians manage to gain a meaningful counteroffensive, get the kind of weaponry, artillery, even fighter jets down the line that they need, and the Russians start stalling in Kharkiv or Odessa, or if there's a hidden twist in Severodonetsk, which delays their capture of Luhansk, then we can see that maybe the Russians talking about dialogue again.
