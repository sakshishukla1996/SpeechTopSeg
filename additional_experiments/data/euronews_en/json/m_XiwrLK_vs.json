Yeah and let's go a little bit back into the dates that was the end of February 2014 27 and 28th of February and pro-russian government seized key buildings in Crimea and for many many Ukrainians for all of the Ukrainians, this is exactly what is considered the beginning of the war. What happened on the 24th of February 2022, this is what Ukrainians see as the beginning of the full-scale invasion. So this is why what Zelensky said was not the official position, just took the authorities in Kiev. This is exactly the point of view by Ukrainians. When the negotiations started in March this year between the two sides, some attempts to negotiate any possible peace deal, Ukrainian side said, look, let's go back to the positions of Russian forces as of the 23rd of February with Donbass and Crimea. Crimea annexed Donbass partially as well with the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic. And then we go back to negotiating those parts but now we're almost six months into this raging war and after everything that happened after Mariupol after Bucha after so many other cities after all these bombings for many Ukrainian that's just too far so now they do feel as they have to take all of the territory of Ukraine back with Crimea and with Donbas so that is then the position politically that President Zelensky has been sketching out. When might we expect, I guess, action in order to make that Ukrainian vision a reality potentially? Well, clearly for many Ukrainians and for the authorities and the military, that would be as soon as possible. We've heard from Major General of Ukrainian Army Dmytro Marchenko, who said that Ukraine plans to de-occupy Kherson and complete the active phase of the war by the end of the year."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [170.14, 208.64], "sentence": " Now of course we're talking about this active phase this is what Ukraine has been focusing over the past couple of weeks when they have been destroying and hitting Russian supply lines, command centers and ammunition supply centers all over Ukraine and those occupied territories currently when it comes to Crimea now the key here would be from two sides to move from two sides that would be from Herson and this is something that we have been seeing recently over the past couple of weeks then Crimea and then of course when it comes to Crimea and the way it is linked to Russia this is the Crimean bridge and Ukrainian authorities have never been hiding the fact that they will be targeting the bridge that was built after the annexation of Crimea in 2014."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [208.64, 212.96], "sentence": " All right.
