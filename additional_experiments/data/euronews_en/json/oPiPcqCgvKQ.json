But when they are being pulled back from Kharkiv, they are being sent towards the east and we're exactly to all that front line in the east with heavy fighting where it continues now for weeks. Paul, Russian forces may be abandoning efforts at wide encirclement of Ukrainian troops along the Izium Slavyansk, the Baitseve line, because this is what they have been trying to do for weeks, but they could not succeed in that. Instead, they might be focusing in a shallower encirclement with smaller towns and Ukrainian forces there. But in order to do so, Russian troops, they had made three unsuccessful attempts to build those bridges that did not work. And according to the governor of Luhansk region Ukrainian defenders beat back the Russians each time. Russia has not commented on anything that happened across that bridge on Siversky Donetsk but we do know that according to the latest data by UK Defense Intelligence Russian battalion lost almost all of its armored vehicles in the attempts to cross that river in eastern Ukraine. And there's been more heavy fighting around in and around Snake Island in the Black Sea. Why is that so strategically important for Russia? Now Snake Island is indeed a very small island that is located around 35 kilometres from the coast of Odessa and about 45 kilometres from the coast of NATO from Romania in the Black Sea. this is the island that Russia took and occupied on the first day of the war you might remember that epic accident and what happened there at the Snake Island was be happening ever since that Russia is trying to strengthen its force and to build up their forces why because they are trying to set up there the long-range air defense and resupply vessels that would give Russia the control of the sea land and air in the northwestern part of the Black Sea. It will also give them the possibility to attack and to shut the southern regions of Ukraine, including Odessa. What happened on Thursday is Russian Navy logistics vessel caught fire. Odessa regional military administration said it was damaged by Ukrainian military. Russia has not commented on that yet and also satellite footage by Maxwell technologies emerged showing Russian military ship that has sunk near the Snake Island which was seized by Russia of course as we said from the very very early days of of this war taking control of the Snake Island would give Russia so much control over that part of the Black Sea and also the possibility to shell the southern regions of Ukraine it's not case I sure thank you so much control over that part of the Black Sea and also the possibility to shell the southern regions of Ukraine."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [305.22, 307.9], "sentence": " Okay, Sasha, thank you so much for that update."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [307.9, 315.06], "sentence": " Let's cross over to Ukraine's southern region of Odessa to our international correspondent, Annalise Borges."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "timestamp": [315.06, 320.84], "sentence": " Annalise, we've just been talking about the battle for Snake Island with Sasha."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "timestamp": [320.84, 348.0], "sentence": " It's an important target when it comes to control of the south where you are.

Many of them do respect President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And one would think that they would accept whatever decision is made to bring this war to a halt. However, many believe the matters now should be settled in the battlefield. And President Zelensky knows that. He has repeatedly said that he's open to negotiate with Vladimir Putin.
