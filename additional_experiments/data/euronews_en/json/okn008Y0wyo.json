Oh dear okay well another thing you mentioned Lady Garg I mean obviously she's a massive superstar as you mentioned now she's had to learn an Italian accent for this role and there's been a lot of talk about this Italian accent tell us more about it. Well yeah ever since the trailer came out in July critics have been sniping about this and the voice coach for Salma Hayek has said that Lady Gaga's accent sounded more Russian than Italian which is ironic as Gaga actually has Italian ancestry now Lady Gaga herself has said, rubbish, she spoke apparently in a northern Italian accent for nine months. Even when the cameras weren't rolling, she apparently never broke character. And she actually said that this kind of method acting really took its toll sort of psychologically because she was either always in character on set performing or always in character off set."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "timestamp": [1242.72, 1243.42], "sentence": " on set performing or always in character, off set."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "timestamp": [1243.42, 1248.24], "sentence": " Well, yeah, a lot has been made of this so-called Russian, or is it not Russian, accent."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "timestamp": [1248.24, 1249.9], "sentence": " Let's move on now to The Beatles."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "timestamp": [1249.9, 1255.84], "sentence": " Now, Peter Jackson's love letter to The Beatles, Get Back, has been released this week also."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "timestamp": [1255.84, 1259.34], "sentence": " Is there anything more we can learn about this Fab Four?"}]]}
