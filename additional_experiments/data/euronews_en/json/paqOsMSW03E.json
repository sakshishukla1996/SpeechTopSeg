Indeed it's good that you put in that reminder that Malta is the only country in the EU with this strict total ban on abortion do you think cases like this and then the interest that it's generating are going to help perhaps overturn this law. Well one would hope so. I mean we have been calling as women's activists. We have been calling for you know for the state to direct to decriminalize and legalize abortion because this has become untenable. I mean we are in the 21st century. We are in 2020. Moldau is at the forefront on many equality laws. We have just recently introduced the recognition of femicide in our law which is makes it only the second country within the European Union that has done that. So we still can't keep on calling that.
