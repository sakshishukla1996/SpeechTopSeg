Well, on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said that he's sending an additional 7,000 troops to Europe in addition to 5,000 already deployed there. However, he's reiterated that these were to defend and reassure NATO members in Eastern Europe and not to engage in a conflict with Russia and in Ukraine. Well, let's cross to Washington DC and speak to Euronews reporter Ray Suarez."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "timestamp": [1300.46, 1310.56], "sentence": " Ray, so the US has offered aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, but President Zelenskyy is saying today really that Ukraine has been left alone."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "timestamp": [1310.56, 1313.92], "sentence": " So, will Washington go further with its aid, you think?"}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [1313.92, 1345.54], "sentence": " RAY SUAREZ, President of the United States of America, Well, with each new escalation on the Russian side of the ledger, there has been an escalation on the Washington side, short of sending troops into Ukraine itself. The Biden administration has been very clear from the very beginning, both in its councils with European allies and its announcements to the world and domestically here talking to the American people that U.S."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [1345.54, 1373.76], "sentence": " troops will not be fighting in Eastern Europe as this crisis continues.

This would put the United States directly in confrontation with Russia.

NATO's very high readiness joint task force, an elite force, specially equipped, specially trained, drawn from multiple NATO nations, is about to head to Eastern Europe, showing a serious upgrading of the kind of commitment NATO is making to defending its eastern flank.

This will only provoke Russia. This is far afield from American interests and no American risks should be taken in Ukraine. So presidents, three of them in a row now, have gotten an earful about what to do. Americans themselves have not been particularly involved on this issue. We have been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, economic problems, and high-volume domestic political conflict. Ukraine has not been front and center here in United States political debates. That may very well change now that Ukraine coverage is dominating American news services.

I don't see any good scenarios here. I think it's a great catastrophe for Russia and Ukraine, what's happening.
