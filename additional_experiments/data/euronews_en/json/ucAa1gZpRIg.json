For more on this we can bring in Alessio Patilano, now professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King's College London. Alessio, I know this is the the question that everyone is asking right now, but do you think this is a prelude to an invasion or perhaps more an effort to intimidate absolutely not and what we're talking about as i say is a core function or it's a core mission of the pla so that the exercises can be sort of like uh uh put into place and let's not forget it's very important I mean, the point always to make out this period of the year, it's a summer exercises for the PLA. So the PLA already had a lot of capabilities and material that was designated for the conduct. And this is a core mission. So the fact that these are loud, they are large scale, they are sort of designed to project fear, to strike, you know, fear in the hearts of the Taiwanese to make this idea that reunification is inevitable, sort of reinforced and underwritten by hard power. So that's no question. But it's a different thing to say that as opposed to sort of emphasizing that this is a preliminary stages of invasion. What could be if they lasted longer, because some of the splash areas are just outside the main ports after it is in Taiwan, create a significant disruption to shipping and as a result sort of like disruption to the Taiwanese economy."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [698.78, 700.78], "sentence": " It depends very much how long they last."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "timestamp": [700.78, 773.34], "sentence": " But short of that, we are not looking at the situation that in principle would indicate that this is a preclude to an invasion. So if these are then larger scale military drills do they tell us anything about the capabilities of the Chinese military? So these are larger in scale and the announcement that we've seen over the last 72 hours suggested that we are likely to see over the next few days additional announcements that would tell us more about how far, how big, the actual extent of the scale of the exercise. As we look at them, in particular in light of the missiles that have already been fired, certainly we'll see larger volumes and greater distances that the capabilities, particularly the missile component for cover and also the splash areas they are sort of in on the eastern side of Taiwan, they further out at sea. So this really speaks to the capacity of the PLA to simply put more steel in the water at greater distances and certainly in terms of the capacity to project the firepower, a much greater capacity that certainly was the case last time we'd seen exercise of this kind early in the 2000s."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [773.34, 779.5], "sentence": " All right, Alessio Patellano, Professor of War and Strategy in East Asia at King's College London."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [779.5, 781.32], "sentence": " Thanks for your time.

In the UK the Bank of England has unveiled its biggest interest rate rise in 27 years to stand at 1.75 percent. The move aims to tackle the soaring cost of living with inflation expected to hit 13 percent in October and the economy expected to hit recession in the final quarter. Well for more on this we can turn to John Ferguson now head of globalization at Economist Impact. John good to have you with us. Do you think that this rate rise from the Bank of England will be sufficient. We'll do enough. It's a huge move. It's really really big news today. And partly many of us were expecting such a significant rise in interest rates. So to say that it's necessary. It was expected. I think that's part of the story. But I think what took us all by surprise today was the related recession forecast that you alluded to. So even though we may have expected an interest rate increase to deal with inflation because it is high. Many of us were sort of blown away by a five quarter recession forecast from the Bank of England. So that was really quite quite a dramatic forecast from the Bank of England. So that was really quite a dramatic forecast from the Bank of England today."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [846.86, 853.42], "sentence": " Yeah, that's certainly, I think, a lot of people said, ouch, in response to that news of the recession."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [853.42, 857.84], "sentence": " Just to be clear then on that, I mean, a recession's one thing."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [857.84, 859.34], "sentence": " It's never good news."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "timestamp": [859.34, 863.62], "sentence": " But you alluded to it being quite prolonged, as I understand it."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "timestamp": [863.62, 866.0], "sentence": " Absolutely.

And in their analysis, in their forecast today, they have given the view that they think inflation will peak at 13%, as you mentioned but also remain stubbornly high almost around double figures for at least another year. So that's the justification. They believe inflation is persistently high and therefore the interest rate increase is necessary despite what they think will be a five quarter recession. So John in all of this we've also heard from the bank that the UK will see living standards fall by 5 percent. So you mentioned you know using the tool of the interest rates. Is there anything else the government could potentially do any tools that it has in its arsenal to help people who are really going to feel this. It's a great question.
