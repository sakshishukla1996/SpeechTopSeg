If you are prime minister, you are Prime Minister, you have all of the powers and responsibilities that go with that post. So it would be untested if they tried to put someone in.

The first one is MPs declare, and that list is whistled down to a final two. And then the second stage, those final two are voted on by the members of the party. I think the party wanted to resolve that first stage before Parliament breaks for recess, so by the end of July that's very quick. You know that we know that there might be a dozen or more candidates running. Lots of names have been bandied around. Lots of people are sort of apparently starting their campaigns for leader.
