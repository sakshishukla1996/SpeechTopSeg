He also stressed that those who fought in Ukraine were among the participants of this parade and promised help to those families whose members were killed in Ukraine. Galina, we know Victory Day is a national holiday, of course, but just how important is it in ordinary people's lives? Because in recent years it seems to have an increasing military significance exactly talks this holiday is extremely important for I will say maybe most of the people in Russia as all of them have someone a member of the family or another like far away relative or a friend who took part in the second world war so this is in history a very tragic history for most of russians and in the recent years they are used to this military showcase of russia's might on this Victory Day. And let's say it's not shocking for most as many remember how it was in the Soviet times and what they are seeing right now is maybe a matter even of pride in some case. The question is really right now, Toks, is how many do realize that there is a totally different history which has been drawn by the state with the help of such important and very powerful tools as the state TV which is broadcasting this parade across all the time zones in Russia. This is a question that nobody can really answer at this point."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [240.0, 249.84], "sentence": " While Russia held its annual victory parade in Moscow, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky opted to release a video."}], [{"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [249.84, 254.34], "sentence": " In it, he walks down a Kiev street where in normal times a parade would be held."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [254.34, 257.72], "sentence": " He said he has no doubt Ukraine will win its war with Russia."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [257.72, 261.84], "sentence": " Today we celebrate the day of victory over Nazism."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [261.84, 265.0], "sentence": " And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [265.0, 273.0], "sentence": " We are proud of our ancestors, who, together with the other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [273.0, 276.0], "sentence": " And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [276.0, 279.0], "sentence": " We will not allow it to be appropriated."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [279.0, 282.0], "sentence": " By anyone he means Vladimir Putin."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [282.0, 291.26], "sentence": " The Kremlin has tried to justify its invasion by blaming it on the West, telling Russians they're once again fighting Nazism."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [291.26, 297.12], "sentence": " The Nazis were expelled from Yalta, Simferopol, Kerch and the entire Crimea."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [297.12, 299.9], "sentence": " Mariupol was liberated from the Nazis."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [299.9, 302.96], "sentence": " They expelled the Nazis from all over Ukraine."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "timestamp": [302.96, 306.06], "sentence": " But the cities I named are especially inspiring for us today."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "timestamp": [306.06, 312.32], "sentence": " They give us faith that we will drive the occupiers out of our land for sure."}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "timestamp": [312.32, 334.64], "sentence": " Zelenskyy signs off saying happy victory over Nazism Day and glory to Ukraine.
